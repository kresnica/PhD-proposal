Liquid crystals are soft materials with a degree of orienataional order in comparison with positional disorder. 
This is achieved by the molecules of liquid crystal being anisotropic, i.e. elongated in one direction, and also reinforced by intermolecular forces.  
In a range of temperatures, they exhibit an additional phase between solid in liquid, in which they retain a degree of orientational order while losing the positional order. 
They have proven to be an important material in soft matter physics with many possibilities for applications in different industries as well, ranging from liquid crystal displays to nematic ordering systems. 

As stated already, their main characteristic is a degree of orientational order combined with positional disorder (in nematics in 3D, at least partial -- 2D -- in smectic liquid crystal). 
Their orientational order leads to several other characteristics. 
First is their elasticity: their free energy increases, if -- because of external fields or boundary conditions -- their orientational order is disturbed. 
With the elasticity, they can take into account the orientational order of colloidal inclusions. 
On the other hand, their orientational order leads into optical anisotropy as well: mostly, liquid crystals possess an extraordinary index of refraction (along the long axis of the molecules) larger than the ordinary index. 
Their optical birefringence opens the possibility for exploitation in optical systems such as waveguides etc. 

They are also easily manipulated with external fields, especially electric field, which tends to turn the long axis of the liquid crystal molecules to be polarized along the field. 
With the electric field, the elastic forces and the optical properties can be controlled. 

The colloidal suspension in liquid crystals have been shown to be ordered because of the elasticity of liquid crystals \cite{1, 2, 3,}: 
Musevic and Smalyukh groups have experimentally shown the elastic forces between the defect structures to be strong enough to achieve orientational ordering of the (spatially anisotropic, i.e. square or triangular) colloids, and also to lower the free energy in such colloidal clusters by arranging. 
Theoretical work has been done by our group as well \cite{cc}. 

Optical applications include waveguides. 
Liquid crystals can be used as an addition to the existing photonic-crystal-like waveguides \cite{dd}, where it has been shown they increase the performance of such structure by XX\%. 
If the photonic fibre is filled exclusively with liquid crystal, it can be used as a waveguide as well, since the refractive-index gradient controls the flow-of-light.

% The field of soft matter is great. 
% But an interesting question would be \ldots how the light interacts with structures made from or interwoven with liquid crystals. 
% Especially interesting is to take into regard the birefringent nature of liquid crystals and to combine it with metamaterial anisotropy.

% \subsection{Platelets}
% 0.5 page
A way to engineer soft (meta-)materials is to combine liquid crystal with metallic colloids. 
The elasticity of liquid crystals affects the distribution and arrangement of colloids. 
As some orientations of the colloid are more favourable in terms of free energy, the horseshoe colloids might, as the theoretical studies of J. Aplinc \cite{jure-HS} show, self-assemble in 2D and 3D crystals. 
The analysis of the interplay between the influences of the geometry of such a photonic crystal and the optical parameters of the materials used provides a rich case of study. 
Since the optical parameters are highly dependent on the frequency of light, diverse response is achieved across different wavelengths. 
Experimental realisation of these ideas would be explored in the team of prof. Muševič, group F5 on JSI. 

% \subsection{Waveguiding}
% 0.25 pages
A crucial reason why to control and manipulate light is to guide it. 
Many different applications, from photonic circuits to waveguides, all designed to convey information, rely on efficient control of light. 
An compelling option for waveguiding is to enhance their properties with liquid crystals. 
In cooperation with prof. Etienne Brasselet from University of Bordeaux, different proposals for waveguides, filled with liquid crystals, will be simulated and analysed theoretically. 
Through different boundary conditions and other manipulation, different director profiles can be introduced into the liquid crystal, which can in turn affect the propagation of light. 
With some director profiles we can achieve focusing; special emphasis will be put on the director profiles which exhibit focusing for positive anisotropy ($n_{o} < n_e$).
